# Multipliers processor

The method **```computerMultipleSum(n)```** should return **the sum of all the positive multiples** of **3** or **5** or *7** strictly below ```n```.

As an example, for ```n=11``` we get **3,5,6,7,9,10** as multiples and the sum of these multiples is **40**.

Implement ```computeMultipleSum(n)```

**Constraints**:

* ```0 <= n < 1000```
